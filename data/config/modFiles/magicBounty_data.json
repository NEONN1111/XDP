The only comprehensible text to be found within is a set of coordinates, highly disconnected and fantastical mentions of some 'monstrous vessel', and what could be interpreted as a promise to a veritable mountain of credits to any captain able to destroy the target. It sounds too good to be true, an entire fortune behind some mystery fleet without even a capital-sized ship present, and your crew do make their concerns known- this reeks of a trap.",
