xdp_blockhead,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Nothing like this, however, could possibly have been deployed by the Domain drone armadas.

At a glance, this amusingly named vessel, the 'Blockhead', appears to be just another automated weapon platform of the Domain Explorarium, as well as a ""support"" vessel used to crush any group that would rebel against the Domain's ironclad authority. However, it differs greatly from other comparable droneships by having an integrated Damper Field of suspiciously high quality, capable of mitigating damage to the degree of a modern example as seen in vessels such as the Vanguard and Mora.  No doubt this ship was used as a relatively small anvil to break anything that could hypothetically threaten one of the great survey ships of the Domain... or anything that could hypothetically threaten the Domain itself from within.

Nothing the Domain's survey motherships' clunky autofabs could have produced would have had specs like the Shrisse. There is some standard droneship frame in it, yes, but it's buried under worryingly smooth and sleek panels. A project of some admiral with a fleeting grasp of reality, or a corrupted forge could be an explanation if not for the obvious purpose in its design. It would not be able to move the way it does if it wasn't built with purpose. Twin EMP emitters, combined with a mount that can fit any weapon types, and its absurd mobility results in something that any spacer would dismiss as legend if told about it without proof. Perhaps inquiring into this ship's origin is not a good idea.",,,,
xdp_derelict_messenger,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume.

miningblaster_builtin,WEAPON,"An example of the unnerving ability of machine intelligences to improve upon existing designs, this weapon utilizes the same fundamental design of the venerated mining blaster. Though, it's internal components have been upgraded and upscaled in order to produce bolts with far more range, and destructive capability than the meagre weapon it originated from. A near-guaranteed death sentence for any ship with it's shields down, vessels fielding it should take priority.",,,,

I don't understand it. This ship has no right to exist. The databanks of even the greatest of the Explorarium's survey motherships didn't feature schematics for anything close to a Dominator. And yet here this hull floats, raked by a thousand Hephaestus shells, and still stubbornly intact. The internal systems failed before the hull did.
But... how? Bit flips by hard radiation over the centuries can't explain a near perfect reproduction of a Dominator's hull form. Are the survey ships learning somehow? That shouldn't be possible. They weren't designed to do that. They weren't given the processing power to do that.
If this gets out, COMSEC is going to be so far up our asses they'll find a lost Planetkiller.",,,,

xdp_trinarch,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Nothing like this, however, could possibly have been deployed by the Domain drone armadas.

Integrated impossibly seamlessly for what the Domain Explorarium's motherships should be capable of producing, the Trinarch class' infrastructure is recognizably modeled after that of TriTachyon's automated warships, with many individual components being nearly identical to those seen within them. Though from what tests have been conducted, they are ultimately incompatible with standard drone ships, unless modifications, albeit light ones, are made. A troubling example of rogue machine intelligence.

❝We need to find out what's causing this. From other reports, and accounts from independent spacers, these things are becoming more and more common. Not even just the 'lesser' ones, but the bigger ones too. Eighteen percent. An eighteen percent increase in activity, in the last four cycles alone. If we don't handle this, if we keep ignoring it... we're going to have another war on our hands. End report.❝",,,,
xdp_luminance,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. This vessel, however, bears little resemblance to its Explorarium sisters, save for the Domain of Man's signature livery proudly plastered across its hull. Smooth and rounded armor plating, symmetrical design, energy shielding, and advanced systems set this vessel far apart from the Domain's known combat drone doctrine.

A terrifyingly agile and maneuverable destroyer-sized vessel, the Luminance's combat performance and almost-unnatural maneuvers are something that no human crew could sustain for any meaningful amount of time without suffering serious injury, or death. Furthermore, the nature of it's Blink Drive, what appears to be a heavily modified phase-skimming array integrated with phase coil technology, would place un-due strain on the bodies of biological crew. Psychological effects can only be guessed at. 

Though past Domain-era research points to Artificial Intelligence suffering rapid degradation and corruption when undergoing phase-space dives, the Luminance class' core housing has been engineered specially to protect and shield against these effects. Still, it isn't a perfect solution, as analysis shows that the influence of this other realm is not fully abated. Given the fact that the ship is not a one-off, though, it is evidently good enough of a design to prevent--or rather, prolong the corruption of it's artificial pilots to an acceptable degree.",,,,

messenger_builtin,WEAPON,"Based loosely on the Devastator cannon, the Herald Defense Cannon is a potent point-defense weapon engineered specifically for usage within the domain's Explorarium fleets. It is a potent piece of artillery, and should not be underestimated.",,,,

Smooth and rounded armor plating, symmetrical design, energy shielding, and advanced systems set this vessel far apart from the Domain's known combat drone doctrine.

A thoroughbred battleship with heavy armor and even heavier armament, the Nemetor ixdp_ires fear as much as it wreaks destruction. Automated hull filled with experimental high-tech systems both matching and not to known technology, the most stand-out feature of this vessel is its highly volatile and presumably experimental flux-grid. Large amounts of hard-flux are continuously vented into a localized pocket of semi-stable p-space within the ship, and violently released upon use of a modified phase skimmer system via propagated disruption, resulting in an immense energy burst inflicting heavy damage to anything caught in the shockwave.

""It shouldn't have been possible- a ship the size of a Paragon, there one moment and somewhere else the next! I couldn't believe my eyes, the entire vessel had teleported a good few times its own length... then the shockwave hit. I was only saved because my harness failed and I got knocked into that escape pod.

This vessel, however, bears little resemblance to its Explorarium sisters, save for the Domain of Man's signature livery proudly plastered across its hull. Smooth and rounded armor plating, symmetrical design, energy shielding, and advanced systems set this vessel far apart from the Domain's known combat drone doctrine.

A brutal design and strong case for the Hegemony's strict control over the usage of AI, the Rampager is a ship that could only have emerged from the most deranged sectors of machine intelligence. The entire ship is underpinned by exotic semi-independent subsystems, leeching power from its surroundings to drive a temporal accelerator only describable as eldritch in nature. Whether due to programmed overrides, induced pseudo-psychosis, or something else entirely unknown, the Rampager seems to take fierce grasp of any captaining AI core- resulting in horrifyingly reckless combat behavior, explained only as consuming, primal rage by those assigned to command it. A weak shield emitter and unimpressive armor betray the ship's durability, as the energy harvested from each vessel felled by the Rampager's hands feeds an elaborate network of self-repair systems capable of regenerating damaged plating. Excessive armament and powerful engines complete the immense capacity for destruction of the Rampager, a final garnish of horror upon such a cruel amalgam of steel and fury.",,,,
xdp_angurvadal,WEAPON,"A highly advanced, general purpose medium range gun battery with high damage and a heavy EMP payload. Its unstable energy bolts are fired in large bursts, prone to detonation before reaching their maximum range.

Built off of a simplified version of the exotic Mjolnir cannon, the Angurvadal sets itself apart from its predecessor with an extra barrel and completely reworked repeating mechanism. Using a lower-powered gravitic lens system and higher exotic matter payload, the Angurvadal's multi-linked firing chamber can release a rapid torrent of projectiles before requiring a lengthy reload. Without the energy bolt coherence provided by a high power gravitic lens, each projectile is highly prone to violent premature detonation across its flight path. Due to this projectile instability, the Angurvadal more closely resembles a flak cannon than a traditional gun battery- spreading its destructive potential across a large area rather than a concentrated single point.",,,,
deepstrikerampager,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages a brief semi-independent subsystem overdrive, increasing timeflow and throwing the ship forwards in a reckless charge.",,,,
xdp_mothership,CUSTOM,"One of the legendary survey motherships, the quiet automated workhorse of the Domain exploration and colonization effort. This is in essence a von Neumann probe, as the survey motherships contain autoforge capacity to manufacture a suite of smaller survey ships and the supplies required to perform its ongoing mission. This specimen is burned and battered by its centuries of service to the Domain, a drifting forgotten hulk.",,,,
xdp_surveyship,CUSTOM,"An automated survey ship from a long-past wave of Domain exploration. Thousands of ships like this were sent in waves, some independent, others attached to (or manufactured by) similarly automated motherships following the first wave of robot probes. This apparently unresponsive hulk has been ravaged by centuries of exposure to charged particles and high velocity impacts from interstellar dust.",,,,

xdp_habplanet,CUSTOM,"A near-terran compatible ecosystem has taken tentative hold on this world despite highly abnormal planetary conditions. That this planet maintains a breathable atmosphere (or near enough) is a testament to the tenacity and adaptability of biological life. Evidence of colonization efforts are visible from orbit, but the planet's once thriving cities and population centers have been scattered to the winds in the wake of the collapse.",,,,

xdp_fueldepot,CUSTOM,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star. Automated fuel processing facilities lie in careful equilibrium beneath the planet's atmosphere, sustained by the antimatter fuel they refine and process, toiling ceaselessly. ",,,,

xdp_recluse,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. This vessel, however, bears little resemblance to its Explorarium sisters, save for the Domain of Man's signature livery proudly plastered across its hull. Smooth and rounded armor plating, symmetrical design, energy shielding, and advanced systems set this vessel far apart from the Domain's known combat drone doctrine.

A drone tender unlike anything known to have been deployed by the old Domain Explorarium fleets, and crammed with bafflingly advanced systems, the Recluse is a vessel that denies initial explanation. A further look into its hull, though, reveals technologies unnervingly similar to what is known of Tri-Tachyon's autonomous fleets left abandoned by the AI wars. Most prevalent is a series of semi-standard autoforges linked directly into the ship's computerized systems, surrounding a miniaturized factory assembly unit with operation not out of place in planetary orbital works. Combined with an advanced distributed fighter targeting array, energy bolt coherence boosters, and plasma-fuel augmented thruster banks, the Recluse finds itself a platform above even cutting-edge modern carriers. 

Theoretically, the fighter autoforge system could also be repurposed to fabricate larger assemblies such as small ships or station parts, though any case of this has not been yet observed. Nevertheless, the implications alone of a fabrication system this advanced in such a relatively small package raises many questions.",,,,
xdp_cardinal,SHIP,"A superheavy fighter design with durability rivalling a light frigate and armament matching that of a destroyer, garnished with a temporal acceleration system, capable of immense force projection from its home carrier.",,,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The objective of this craft's strange design seems to be mounting a massive, archaic EMP emitter, to act as a disabler against vessels larger than itself and to allow smaller dronefleets to take on threats they would otherwise be unable to contend with.

Even in what passes for low power while the emitter is on standby, it is capable of holding an absurd level of charge through the constant rotation of it's two fly-wheel rotors. That, along with the vessel's tendency to disable and/or damage it's own weapon systems may explain why the Perun is a rarer sight within the fleets of the Explorarium.",,,,
